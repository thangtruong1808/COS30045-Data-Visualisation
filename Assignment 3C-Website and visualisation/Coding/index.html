        <h3><strong>Dataset 1 - Economic growth recovered strongly</strong></h3>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, had a significant negative impact on the
          global economy. However, the economy has recovered rapidly since the pandemic subsided. We have obtained
          sample
          datasets from the OECD Statistics website and have encoded them into various charts.
          These visualizations not only present raw data but also narrate the story of economic health and trends over
          time. They serve as powerful tools for economists, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the
          dynamics of economic growth.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Line Chart:</strong>
          <span>Each line represents a crucial economic indicator: Employment, Real Domestic Demand, and Nominal
            Domestic
            Demand. The x-axis, spanning from January 2016 to December 2025, sets the stage for this temporal narrative,
            while the y-axis captures the magnitude of these indicators.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employment:</strong>
            <span>
              This line illustrates the trends in employment levels over a specified period. Tracking employment is
              vital
              as it serves as a key indicator of the labour market’s health and, by extension, the overall economy. High
              employment levels typically signal a robust economy with ample job opportunities, whereas declining
              employment can indicate economic distress. By analyzing employment data, economists and policymakers can
              assess the effectiveness of economic policies, identify emerging trends, and make informed decisions to
              promote job creation and economic stability. Understanding these trends helps in crafting strategies to
              address unemployment and foster a thriving labour market.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Domestic Demand:</strong>
            <span>
              This indicator measures the total demand for goods and services within the economy, adjusted for
              inflation.
              By accounting for inflation, it provides a clearer picture of the true purchasing power within the
              economy.
              This metric is crucial for understanding the actual economic activity, as it reflects the real consumption
              and investment behaviours of households and businesses. Analyzing Real Domestic Demand helps economists
              and
              policymakers gauge the underlying strength of the economy and make informed decisions to foster
              sustainable
              growth.

            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nominal Domestic Demand:</strong>
            <span>This metric represents the total demand for goods and services within the economy, measured in current
              prices without adjusting for inflation. Unlike Real Domestic Demand, which accounts for changes in price
              levels, Nominal Domestic Demand reflects the raw, unadjusted figures. This means that it can be
              significantly influenced by inflation or deflation, as it captures the total expenditure at prevailing
              prices. By examining Nominal Domestic Demand, economists can gain insights into the overall spending
              behavior within the economy, though it is important to consider it alongside inflation data to understand
              the true economic conditions. This measure is crucial for identifying trends in consumer and business
              spending, and for making informed decisions regarding fiscal and monetary policies.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Bar Chart:</strong>

          <span>
            The Bar Chart provides a visual representation of employment data spanning multiple years. Each bar
            corresponds to the total employment for a specific year, making it easy to see how employment levels have
            changed over time. The x-axis, which displays the years, facilitates straightforward comparisons between
            different periods. This visualization is particularly useful for identifying trends, such as periods of
            economic growth where employment levels rise, or times of economic downturn where employment may decline. By
            examining these patterns, economists and policymakers can gain valuable insights into the health of the
            labour
            market and the broader economy. This information can then be used to inform decisions and strategies aimed
            at
            promoting job creation and economic stability.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Area Chart:</strong>
          <span>
            The Area Chart offers a comprehensive visualization of Real Domestic Demand over nearly a decade, spanning
            from 2016 to 2025. This crucial economic indicator measures the total demand for goods and services within
            the
            economy, adjusted for inflation, thereby providing a clear and accurate picture of actual purchasing power
            and
            economic activity. The chart not only highlights the overall demand but also illustrates how Real Domestic
            Demand has evolved over the years. By examining the filled area, one can easily identify periods of
            increased
            or decreased demand, reflecting the economic highs and lows during this timeframe. The y-axis, which
            represents the values of Real Domestic Demand, facilitates straightforward comparisons across different
            years,
            making it easier to spot trends and patterns in economic activity. This visualization is invaluable for
            economists and policymakers as it helps them understand the underlying dynamics of the economy, assess the
            effectiveness of economic policies, and make informed decisions to promote sustainable growth.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Scatter plot Chart:</strong>
          <span>This scatter plot serves as an effective tool for illustrating the changes in Nominal Domestic Demand
            over
            time, offering a clear and engaging method to visualize economic data. Nominal Domestic Demand is an
            important
            economic indicator that measures the total demand for goods and services within the economy at current
            prices,
            without adjusting for inflation. This means it reflects the raw expenditure figures, capturing the impact of
            price level changes over the years. The y-axis, which displays the values of Nominal Domestic Demand, allows
            for straightforward comparisons across different years, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in
            economic activity. By examining the scatter plot, one can observe how demand has fluctuated, pinpointing
            periods of economic expansion or contraction. This visualization is particularly useful for economists and
            policymakers as it provides insights into consumer and business spending behaviours, helping to inform
            decisions and strategies aimed at fostering economic stability and growth.</span>

        <strong>PieChart: </strong>
        <span>Based on the OECD dataset, the pie chart illustrates Australia’s economic journey from Q4 2019 to Q2 2023. Starting at a baseline of 100, the chart shows the pandemic’s initial impact with a dip to 99.77 in Q1 2020 and a significant drop to 93.11 in Q2 2020. This period marks the lowest point, reflecting early pandemic economic strain. However, the economy begins to recover, climbing to 96.61 in Q3 2020 and nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels by Q4 2020 at 99.82. The recovery continues into 2021, with Q1 increasing to 101.95 and Q2 reaching 102.64. Despite a slight dip in Q3 2021 to 100.53, the value rebounds to 104.43 by Q4 2021. The upward trend persists into 2022, peaking at 107.26 in Q4 2022. The first half of 2023 maintains this positive trajectory, with Q1 at 107.66 and Q2 reaching a new high of 108.04. The legends, positioned neatly to the side, highlight these quarterly changes, each colour symbolizing a different period and its corresponding economic value, showcasing the highs and lows of Australia’s market activities over the years..</span>
