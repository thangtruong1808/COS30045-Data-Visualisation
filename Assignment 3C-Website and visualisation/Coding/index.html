      <h3><strong>Dataset 1 - Economic growth recovered strongly</strong></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      <p>
        There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, had a significant negative impact on the
        global economy. However, the economy has recovered rapidly since the pandemic subsided. We have obtained sample
        datasets from the OECD Statistics website and have encoded them into various charts.
        These visualizations not only present raw data but also narrate the story of economic health and trends over
        time. They serve as powerful tools for economists, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the
        dynamics of economic growth.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Line Chart:</strong>
        <span>Each line represents a crucial economic indicator: Employment, Real Domestic Demand, and Nominal Domestic
          Demand. The x-axis, spanning from January 2016 to December 2025, sets the stage for this temporal narrative,
          while the y-axis captures the magnitude of these indicators.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment:</strong>
          <span>
            This line illustrates the trends in employment levels over a specified period. Tracking employment is vital
            as it serves as a key indicator of the labour marketâ€™s health and, by extension, the overall economy. High
            employment levels typically signal a robust economy with ample job opportunities, whereas declining
            employment can indicate economic distress. By analyzing employment data, economists and policymakers can
            assess the effectiveness of economic policies, identify emerging trends, and make informed decisions to
            promote job creation and economic stability. Understanding these trends helps in crafting strategies to
            address unemployment and foster a thriving labour market.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real Domestic Demand:</strong>
          <span>
            This indicator measures the total demand for goods and services within the economy, adjusted for inflation.
            By accounting for inflation, it provides a clearer picture of the true purchasing power within the economy.
            This metric is crucial for understanding the actual economic activity, as it reflects the real consumption
            and investment behaviours of households and businesses. Analyzing Real Domestic Demand helps economists and
            policymakers gauge the underlying strength of the economy and make informed decisions to foster sustainable
            growth.

          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nominal Domestic Demand:</strong>
          <span>This metric represents the total demand for goods and services within the economy, measured in current
            prices without adjusting for inflation. Unlike Real Domestic Demand, which accounts for changes in price
            levels, Nominal Domestic Demand reflects the raw, unadjusted figures. This means that it can be
            significantly influenced by inflation or deflation, as it captures the total expenditure at prevailing
            prices. By examining Nominal Domestic Demand, economists can gain insights into the overall spending
            behavior within the economy, though it is important to consider it alongside inflation data to understand
            the true economic conditions. This measure is crucial for identifying trends in consumer and business
            spending, and for making informed decisions regarding fiscal and monetary policies.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <span></span>
      <p><strong>Bar Chart:</strong>

        <span>
          The Bar Chart provides a visual representation of employment data spanning multiple years. Each bar
          corresponds to the total employment for a specific year, making it easy to see how employment levels have
          changed over time. The x-axis, which displays the years, facilitates straightforward comparisons between
          different periods. This visualization is particularly useful for identifying trends, such as periods of
          economic growth where employment levels rise, or times of economic downturn where employment may decline. By
          examining these patterns, economists and policymakers can gain valuable insights into the health of the labour
          market and the broader economy. This information can then be used to inform decisions and strategies aimed at
          promoting job creation and economic stability.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Area Chart:</strong>
        <span>
          The Area Chart offers a comprehensive visualization of Real Domestic Demand over nearly a decade, spanning
          from 2016 to 2025. This crucial economic indicator measures the total demand for goods and services within the
          economy, adjusted for inflation, thereby providing a clear and accurate picture of actual purchasing power and
          economic activity. The chart not only highlights the overall demand but also illustrates how Real Domestic
          Demand has evolved over the years. By examining the filled area, one can easily identify periods of increased
          or decreased demand, reflecting the economic highs and lows during this timeframe. The y-axis, which
          represents the values of Real Domestic Demand, facilitates straightforward comparisons across different years,
          making it easier to spot trends and patterns in economic activity. This visualization is invaluable for
          economists and policymakers as it helps them understand the underlying dynamics of the economy, assess the
          effectiveness of economic policies, and make informed decisions to promote sustainable growth.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Scatter plot Chart:</strong>
        <span>This scatter plot serves as an effective tool for illustrating the changes in Nominal Domestic Demand over
          time, offering a clear and engaging method to visualize economic data. Nominal Domestic Demand is an important
          economic indicator that measures the total demand for goods and services within the economy at current prices,
          without adjusting for inflation. This means it reflects the raw expenditure figures, capturing the impact of
          price level changes over the years. The y-axis, which displays the values of Nominal Domestic Demand, allows
          for straightforward comparisons across different years, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in
          economic activity. By examining the scatter plot, one can observe how demand has fluctuated, pinpointing
          periods of economic expansion or contraction. This visualization is particularly useful for economists and
          policymakers as it provides insights into consumer and business spending behaviours, helping to inform
          decisions and strategies aimed at fostering economic stability and growth.</span>
